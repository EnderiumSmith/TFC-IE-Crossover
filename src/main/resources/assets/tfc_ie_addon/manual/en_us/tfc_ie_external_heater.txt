Electric Crucible?
It's even better!
There is no Electric Crucible in this mod, but the External Heater is made to be able to heat a Crucible just like a Charcoal Forge.
Consuming <config;i;crucibleExternalHeaterFEPerTick>IF/t, it heats a Crucible up to <config;i;crucibleExternalHeaterTemperature>Â°C.
